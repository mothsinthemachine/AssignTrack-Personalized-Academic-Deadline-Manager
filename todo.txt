#crazy idea-add a feature to look at prev submitted assighnments giving it to an ai that changes the file around to stop plagirism
then give it to other users with their assighnment

##much much much later
#go through prints so no sensitive information is logged


#check on much much later
##can edit token even when cookie has expired-needs to be fixed


#much later
##add the amount of attempts a user had and the time for the verification code to be useable

#later
check all redirect in app.py to make sure im not sending sensitive information through GET

#tmrw
#add a part to the database that stores last sent notification making sure to get datetime 
now for 10 min knowing its expired and add all this in queries


#tmrw
before publicising code c check security measures

##to_do
-add an error page that tells the user info has already been taken unverified_to_verified_user
-add a function that automatically deleted old pending users 

#errors when saving users show on page
